On a sheet pan, drizzle a head of chopped cauliflower and six skin-on garlic cloves with some olive oil, salt, pepper, and red chile flakes. 
Roast at 425Â°, tossing occasionally, until the cauliflower is caramelized and crisp, about 30 minutes.
Once cool, peel the roasted garlic cloves.

In a large bowl, combine a cup of grated Parmesan, three tablespoons of butter, a pinch of salt, two tablespoons of toasted pine nuts, and a quarter-cup of toasted breadcrumbs. 
(Pro tip: Toast stale bread until lightly golden, then use a food processor to pulse into crumbs. 
Store in a large resuable plastic bag in the freezer and never not have breadcrumbs again.)

Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook a pound of short pasta (like cavatelli). 
Drain the pasta, reserving about a cup of the cooking liquid (I usually end up using around quarter-cup). 
Toss the hot pasta with the cauliflower, garlic cloves, Parmesan butter mixture, and enough pasta water to mix it all together.
Garnish with a handful of torn parsley leaves.
