1 garlic clove, finely grated
1½ tsp. ground coriander
1½ tsp. ground cumin
3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
½ medium head of cauliflower (about ¾ lb.), broken into large florets, sliced ¼" thick
1 15-oz. can chickpeas, rinsed
Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
¾ cup whole-milk Greek yogurt
4 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice, divided
1 medium fennel bulb, halved lengthwise, very thinly sliced crosswise
1 small chile (such as serrano, Fresno, or jalapeño; optional), thinly sliced
1 cup very coarsely chopped parsley
1 Tbsp. toasted sesame seeds


Preheat oven to 400°. Mix garlic, coriander, cumin, and 3 Tbsp. oil in a large bowl. Add cauliflower and chickpeas; season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat.

Transfer cauliflower mixture to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Wipe out bowl; reserve.
Bake, tossing halfway through, until chickpeas and cauliflower are golden brown and cauliflower is tender, 18–22 minutes.

Meanwhile, mix yogurt, 1 Tbsp. lemon juice, and a big pinch of salt in a small bowl.

Toss fennel, chile (if using), parsley, sesame seeds, and remaining 3 Tbsp. lemon juice in reserved bowl; season with salt.

Spread yogurt mixture in serving bowls. Top with spiced chickpea mixture. Scatter fennel salad over, then drizzle with oil.
