Grandma Stroh’s stuffing
1 loaf Home pride or similar white bread 
2 sticks butter
2 stalks celery with some of the leaves, chopped 
1 ½ C chopped yellow onion
Salt, pepper and poultry seasoning. 

Toast bread on single rack in oven @ 250 degrees for 10 min.  Turn over and toast for 10 min more.  Cut bread into 1” squares
Divide bread, celery and onion into two portions.  You will make stuffing in two batches.
Melt one cube butter in frying pan with high sides on #7 (out of 10) heat.  When butter is melted add one portion of celery and onion.  Sauté stirring frequently for about 5-7 minutes.  Butter froth will turn beige.
Add bread cubes to pan and toss (like a salad) with two wooden spoons for about 2 minutes.
Turn heat down to #5; continue tossing and add ¼ cup of chicken broth.  Continue tossing and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.  When liquid has been absorbed and bread is starting to look a little dry, add ¼ C more broth.  Sprinkle lightly with poultry seasoning and continue tossing bread cubes for a total of about 5-7 minutes.  Bread cubes will absorb all of the flavoring of butter, broth, celery, onion and spices during this time.  
When stuffing is nicely brown, remove from heat and empty onto cookie sheet to cool.  At this point you can sprinkles a little more poultry seasoning to taste if you wish.  Stuffing will get more flavorful as it sits and stuffing from inside bird will be more flavorful.  It’s better to err on the side of bland than to over season.
Make second batch just like the first.  Adjust cooking times and seasonings if you wish.  
Refrigerate overnight.  Lightly stuff chicken or turkey.  Warm the remainder of the stuffing.  When chicken or turkey is finished, remove stuffing and combine with warmed stuffing. 
One loaf is enough for a roast chicken.  I usually make 3 loaves for a turkey.
