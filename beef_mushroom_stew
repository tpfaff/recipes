Ingredients

1 pound lamb stew meat

2 garlic cloves minced

4 large carrots cut in rounds

4 stalks celery

1 onion rough chopped

1 fennel bulb rough chopped

1 package (6 ounces) oyster mushrooms rough chopped

1 cup merlot or other red wine

2 tablespoons olive oil

1 tablespoon each of oregano, parsley, and thyme (fresh, dried, or a combination)

Salt and pepper to taste

Directions

Start with an ovenproof pan with a lid that is also safe on the stove, or transfer items from a skillet to an ovenproof pan with a lid to bake.

Preheat the oven to 275ยบ.

Add olive oil to the pan. Add heat and brown the meat. You may need to do this in two steps to not crowd the pan. Remove the meat (drain if there is a lot of fat at the bottom of the pan) and cook the onions and garlic until transparent. Add the carrots, celery, fennel, mushrooms, and wine to the pan. Add a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix well and cover. Bake for 3 hours.

Enjoy with a fresh green salad and a side of amaranth or millet.
