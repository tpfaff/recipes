BERBERE LENTILS (YEMISIR WOT)

 

My personal favourite dish is intensely spiced, thanks to Ethiopia’s complex and fiery spice blend, berbere. It’s sold in Ethiopian grocers, but I buy mine at Mister Greek Meat Market (801 Danforth, west of Jones Ave.). Serve this and all the following Ethiopian recipes with injera (the spongy flatbread).

3/4 cup (185 mL) canola oil

1-1/2 medium yellow onions, finely chopped

1/2 cup (125 mL) berbere spice blend, or to taste

1 tbsp (15 mL) puréed fresh, peeled ginger

2 tsp (10 mL) puréed fresh garlic

1 cup (250 mL) dried red lentils, washed

3 cups (750 mL) water + more if needed

1/2 tsp (2 mL) fine sea salt, or to taste

In medium saucepan, heat oil over medium. Add onions. Cook, stirring, 8 minutes. Stir in berbere, ginger and garlic. Cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add lentils. Cook, stirring, 1 minute.

Add 3 cups (750 mL) water. Bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer, stirring often and adding water if needed, until lentils disintegrate and mixture is a thick stew, about 30 minutes. Taste; season with salt.

Makes about 4 cups (1L).
