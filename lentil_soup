Lentil soup recipe... (I doubled it yesterday bc I'll be freezing a bunch of leftovers for later)
-1 cup lentils 
-combine with 3-4 times the amount of water and bring to a boil
-reduce to a simmer, then once they're almost fully cooked, blend them using a hand blender or food processor
-meanwhile!!! Dice one medium onion and saut√© it with salt and other seasonings (pepper, cumin, and ginger.. I also added white pepper)
-add carrots and celery (roughly 2 carrots and 4 celery) that are cut up really small 
-after you've blended the lentils and cooked the veggies, combine everything and bring to a boil
-add more of all the seasonings until it tastes good!!!!!!!
