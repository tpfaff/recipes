INGREDIENTS
2 medium Persian cucumbers, thinly sliced into rounds
Kosher salt
1 ½" piece ginger, peeled, finely grated
5 Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar, divided
1 red chile, such as Holland or Fresno, thinly sliced, seeded if you’re spice-averse
¼ cup low-sodium soy sauce
3 Tbsp. honey
1 12-oz. block firm tofu, drained, patted dry
¼ cup neutral oil, such as grapeseed, canola, peanut, or vegetable
4 oz. dried soba noodles
2 Tbsp. tahini
3 scallions, thinly sliced on a diagonal
RECIPE PREPARATION
* Toss cucumbers and a few pinches of salt in a colander. Let sit until salt begins to draw out water from cucumbers, about 5 minutes. Massage cucumbers, gently at first to keep them from breaking, then more vigorously as they start to expel water. Drain and squeeze out excess liquid again. Transfer cucumbers to a small bowl. Add ginger and 1 Tbsp. vinegar and toss to combine. Chill until ready to use.
* Whisk chile, soy sauce, honey, and 3 Tbsp. vinegar in a medium bowl.
* Cut tofu into 9 square-ish pieces by cutting the block into thirds, then cutting each third crosswise into 3 pieces. Pat dry.
* Heat oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Cook tofu, undisturbed, until very crisp and dark brown underneath, 4–5 minutes. Transfer tofu to a plate; wipe out skillet. Heat skillet over medium-high. Return tofu to skillet and add soy sauce mixture (reserve medium bowl; you’ll use it again). Cook, turning tofu occasionally and reducing heat to medium if needed, until glaze is almost thick enough to coat a spoon, about 4 minutes.
* Meanwhile, cook soba noodles according to package directions; drain. Do not rinse noodles, even if the instructions tell you to—you want them to stay warm.
* Transfer tofu to a plate, leaving sauce in pan. Pour sauce into reserved medium bowl. Whisk in tahini and remaining 1 Tbsp. vinegar. Add noodles and toss until coated with sauce.
* Divide noodles among bowls. Top with tofu, pickled cucumbers, and scallions.
