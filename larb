First, thinly slice half a red onion and place in a small bowl with a few tablespoons of rice vinegar. Let it hang out in the fridge until you're ready to eat. Meanwhile, steam some white rice.

Next, the chicken. Heat a slick of vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat until shimmering.
Add a pound of ground chicken, two minced garlic cloves, three thinly sliced scallions (whites and greens), and a couple of sliced chiles.
I like to use fiery Thai birds eye chiles, but jalape√±o, serrano, or Fresno would also work. 
Season with a little salt and pepper and cook until chicken is cooked through and browned. 
Stir in two tablespoons of soy sauce, a teaspoon of fish sauce, a small spoonful of sambal oelek or other hot sauce (like sriracha), and a tablespoon of brown sugar, cooking until the liquid is almost completely reduced.
Serve the larb with rice, Bibb or butter lettuce leaves, lime wedges, quick-pickled onions, more sambal oelek, and torn herbs like cilantro, basil, and mint.
